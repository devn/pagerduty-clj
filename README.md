## Usage

  :dependencies [[devn/pagerduty "0.1.0"]
                 ...])
```

Require it:

```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require [pagerduty.incidents :refer :all]))
```

Use it:

(with-defaults [token "MYTOKEN"
                subdomain "MYSUBDOMAIN"]
  (get-incidents :sort_by "created_on:desc"))
```
